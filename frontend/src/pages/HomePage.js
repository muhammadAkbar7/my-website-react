      <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
      <article>
        <p>During my web development course, I have explored various technologies and frameworks. Some of the major ones include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML: Used for creating and structuring the content of web pages with elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.</li>
          <li>CSS: Stands for Cascading Style Sheets, used for describing the presentation and layout of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, and spacing.</li>
          <li>JS (JavaScript): A high-level programming language that enables interactive web pages and dynamic content by manipulating the DOM.</li>
          <li>Node (Node.js): A JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling backend development with JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Express (Express.js): A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for building web and mobile applications.</li>
          <li>Asynchronous programming: Allows operations to execute without blocking the main program flow, enabling tasks to run concurrently with other code.</li>
          <li>DOM (Document Object Model): A programming interface for web documents that represents the structure of HTML or XML documents as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to update the content, structure, and style dynamically.</li>
          <li>React: A JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications, through reusable components that manage their own state.</li>
          <li>REST (Representational State Transfer): Used for designing networked applications where resources are identified by URLs and manipulated using a set of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</li>
          <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Best Practices</li>
          <li>MongoDB: A NoSQL database management system that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for scalable and high-performance data storage and retrieval.</li>
          <li>CRUD: Stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations for managing data in a database.</li>
          <li>Mongoose: A library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a schema-based solution to model application data and simplifies interactions with MongoDB databases.</li>
          <li>SPA (Single Page Application): A web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without requiring full page reloads.</li>
          <li>HTML: Used for creating and structuring the content of web pages with elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.</li>
        </ul>
