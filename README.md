********

1) In the env file for the backend folder; put own mongo db details in the format "MONGODB_CONNECT_STRING="

2) To install node_modules files, do a npm install in a integrated terminal for both the backend and frontend folder.

3) To run both frontend and backend do the same as step 2 but do npm run.
